An addon for Dota 2, I intend for it to contain several sub game modes such as Legends of Dota and Random OMG

Legends of Dota is partly done, I have most of it written in JS, needs to be ported to LUA. I have some classes setup for the GUI side of things.

###Current Status##
 - There is a bare basic pick your skills GUI, which seems to fully work
 - Depending on how you load the server, the hud might never show, after hero selection, try: send_shit in the console, and it should load the hud up (this will of course, be fixed)

###What's next?###
 - Next is some sort of a voting UI and a game mode loader for different game modes
